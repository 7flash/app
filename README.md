at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install the Phundament application template using the following command:

~~~
composer.phar create-project phundament/app:4.0.x-dev app-v4
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `app-v4` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

http://localhost/app-v4/web/
~~~
