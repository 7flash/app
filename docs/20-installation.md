Installation
============

Requirements
------------

 - Docker (boot2docker)
 - docker-compose

> Note: You can run Phundament also by installing it with [composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix) or within a Vagrant VM. But we recommend docker, since it provides a consistent environment



Name directory like your project, because of `docker-compose`
